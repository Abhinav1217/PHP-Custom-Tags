#[0.2.0] [03.09.2008] 
	- CHANGED the way callback and collections are parsed. They now are parsed
	  via function callbacks instead of includes, thus optimizing the included
	  files and script executions.
	- ADDED the ability to turn block caching off on particular tags when tag
	  caching is enabled, by using the cache="false" attribute.
	
#[0.1.0] [12.07.2008] 
	- Initial Release
